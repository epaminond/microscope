# Microscope

Microscope is a test project of simple social news app that lets you share links, comment, and vote on them.

It was built with [Meteor](http://meteor.com) as a companion app to [The Meteor Book](http://discovermeteor.com), and is the "little brother" of [Telescope](http://telesc.pe), the (much more complex) open-source social news app that was the inspiration for the book.

This app differs from original one: it uses coffescript and [jade](https://github.com/mquandalle/meteor-jade).
